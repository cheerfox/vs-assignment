### Task 2: Coding assignment 2

You can accomplish this task using any JavaScript framework you like, or even with pure JavaScript.

-   Now we have two buttons:
    -   Button 1: With the text "start".
    -   Button 2: With the text "end".

Expect: Click button 1 first, wait a few seconds, and then click button 2. The browser should display the time duration between these two click.
